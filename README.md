# Green_Icons
 Update Adv with XSB Green Icons


### Background
The purpose of this project workflow is to generate a list of GSINs after every quarterly XSB catalog run. The  input for this PDI does not require to make any changes to the 'Var_Catalog_Table' since it uses the latest library (ADV.Advantage_XSB_Analyzed_Current).  The output is one excel file `Green_Icons_Adv.xls` populated with data for three tabs. The results are to be emailed attaching the excel sheet. This template can be used:
